Today is my first day of fasting. The transit Moon is in Libra, an air sign which suits to me as my sun sign and ascendent are air signs too.

What makes me think is that my Libra is in the 8th House, the astrological space where you can read about your karma, which in my case has 2 retrogrades in conjunction: Saturn + Neptun.

How shall I read this transit Moon in the first day of my fasting? 
Immediately I think that I am going to work on that planetary knot, the two Retrogrades. Somehow I have the feeling of liberation, of putting the suffering Planets more at ease now.

The desire of harmony and beauty of Libra gets intensified by the transiting Moon. This will be the leitmotive of my fasting. 
Which is indeed what moved me to go into this purification time.

On the other hand I also think of my two Lords of the 8th house: will it be possible to bring them some more easiness and comfort?
