Third day of fasting. Moon still in Libra but in void of course until tomorrow. It means there is an inner void which requires caution, remaining still. I should try to go out today but I am not sure about how I could manage. The headache from yesterday is still stalking me.

19 lunar day, its symbol is the spider web. Today's suggestion: "clean yourself and your home. Repent, pray, think over your actions. Get rid of useless things." My fasting intention is exactly that: leaving behind the past because the past is gone and I shouldn't clinging to it. If I want future I must let go the old!
