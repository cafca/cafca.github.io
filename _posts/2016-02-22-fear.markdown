'We’re all of us afraid of many things, but if you make yourself smaller or let your fear confine you, then you really aren’t your own person at all—are you? The real question is whether or not you will risk what it takes to be happy.' [Paula McLain, Circling the Sun]

Fasting brings an ancestral fear along. We are afraid of starving. And yet, fasting is an incredible purification and rejuvenation "tool". Besides, it has strongly to do with the rituality belonging to the Way of the Warrior. When you fast you have to go through anxiety and some bit of physical discomfort. You have to be patient with yourself and with your body, both busy at work with themselves... You can't accelerate the slow process of rebirth, you have to delicately wait until you have walked each little single step of this path. Going through this intense stress with soft courage.

Nevertheless, not everybody can go through a fasting time. If you are not in touch with your inner self and your body I suggest you not to try. It is too dangerous if you can't recognise your body signals!

“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” [Frank Herbert, DuneDune]
