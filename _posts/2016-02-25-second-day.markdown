Second day: Moon still in Libra. I feel particularly tired today, with a slight headache due to the detoxing process. I had to take different rests during the day. Nevertheless I feel the body more at ease, as if, this time, it feels like to get rid of all the dis-eases of the last years.
I am satisfied.
